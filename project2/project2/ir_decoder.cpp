// In order to decode IR packets, the Arduino needs to be configured to
// tell time and generate interrupts on positive going edges.  The
// edge sensitivity is used to detect the first incoming IR packet.
// The PinD2 (i.e. INT0) pin change ISR will then toggle the edge sensitivity of
// the interrupt in order to measure the times of the high and low
// pulses arriving from the IR decoder.
//
// Timer 1 must be enabled so that we can tell how long the pulses
// last.  In some degenerate cases, we will need to generate a interrupt
// when the timer rolls over.  This will indicate the end of a packet
// and will be used to alert main that we have a new packet.
